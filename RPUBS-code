#Description of the data:

```{r data}
library(readxl)
mydata <- read_excel("~/mydata.xlsx")
View(mydata)
```

```{r head}
head(mydata) 
```

```{r dim}
dim(mydata) #dimensions, or shape
```
 
```{r str}
str(mydata) #Get Structure
```
 
```{r sum}
 summary(mydata) # information about all variables
```

```{r describe}
library(psych)
describe(mydata) #And you'll get several more statistics from the data including standard deviation, "mad" (mean absolute deviation), skew (measuring whether or not the data distribution is symmetrical) and kurtosis (whether the data have a sharp or flatter peak near its mean).
```

#MISSING DATA
```{r miss}
is.na(mydata) #the missingness indicator
sum(is.na(mydata)) #identify count of NAs in data frame
colSums(is.na(mydata)) #shortcut to compute the total missing values in each column is to use

library(mice)
md.pattern(mydata) # The pattern of missing data
```

## General Plot
```{r mydata, echo=FALSE}
library(VIM)
mydata_aggr = aggr(mydata, col=mdc(1:8), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(mydata), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c("Proportion of missingness","Missingness Pattern"))
plot(mydata)
```


#CLEANING DATA
```{r clean}
library(dplyr)
mydata = mydata %>% na.omit() #Remove rows with missing data
summary(mydata)

```
